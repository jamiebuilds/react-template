# Stylelint is setup to run on everything by default to ensure maximum stylishness
# However, Stylelint doesn't support every file type, and some files dont need to
# be stylish. So they are "ignored" using glob patterns in this file in a similar
# fashion to .gitignore

# third party deps dont need linting
node_modules

# nor do built things
dist
.temp

# tests
.nyc_output
coverage

# these things are just not supported by stylelint
